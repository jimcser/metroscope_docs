# R Code for the MetroScope forecast tool
 
## Overview 
MetroScope is an integrated set of econometric, land use, and transport models, currently used at [Oregon Metro](https://www.oregonmetro.gov/) for producing regional forecasts and evaluating a wide range of policy scenarios.  

For each forecast year, regional control totals for demographics, households, and employment are provided from an econometric model.  The land use model takes these forecasts and distributes them spatially over the buildable land capacity for the entire region.  A transport module is integrated with the land use model, so that the household and employment distributions can respond to changes in travel time.
